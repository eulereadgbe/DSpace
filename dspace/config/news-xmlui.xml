<p>Aquatic News Index (ANI) contains aquatic science-related newspaper articles appearing in various Philippine newspapers available at the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEADEC/AQD) Library. Indexing begins in 1974 to the present. ANI is maintained by SEAFDEC/AQD Library staff.</p>
<p>Entries are grouped according to the newspaper source. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the index entries, subject descriptors were assigned using the Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts (ASFA) Thesaurus, while the geographic names were assigned using the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN).</p>
