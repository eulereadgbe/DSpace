        <p><b>BAHÁNDÌAN</b>, the Central Philippine University institutional repository, has been developed with the  aim of providing access and preserving researches and scientific resources produced by the University. The materials available in the website comprises articles, theses, dissertations, reports, and related content and is used within an Open Access framework.</p>
        <p>The University makes every reasonable effort to reach agreement on the use of digital texts and images with the holders of the intellectual property rights. Materials provided in fulltext are those with copyright/ licensing  agreement. For theses and dissertations where an expressed copyright agreement is not possible because one or more entitled parties or heirs cannot be traced or because the policy of the publisher is unknown to the administrators, the repository only provides bibliographic data and abstracts of these unpublished works in accordance with university policies,  Copyright law and related statutes. These bibliographic data and abstracts have always been made openly available to the public through Henry Luce III Library Online Public Access Catalog upon deposit of a print copy of the unpublished research as a prerequisite for certain courses.</p>
        <p>Persons or institutions who wish to exercise potential rights to texts or digital objects published on the website  should contact the Repository Team, specifying the title and the related material.</p>
        <p>This site is designed for educational, and research purposes. No payment is made for material submitted for publication and reference on the site. Central Philippine University will not be held responsible for improper use of the site, or for rights or claims deriving from the use of the site.</p>
